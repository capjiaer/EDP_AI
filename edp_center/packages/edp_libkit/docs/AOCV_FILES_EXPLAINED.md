# AOCV Files Explained

## Overview
Advanced On-Chip Variation (AOCV) files contain statistical timing models that account for process variations across the chip.

## File Types
- `.aocv` - AOCV coefficient files
- `.aocvm` - AOCV model files

## Usage
These files are used during timing analysis to model systematic and random variations in timing paths.

## Integration
AOCV files are typically loaded in timing analysis tools like PrimeTime for more accurate timing closure.
